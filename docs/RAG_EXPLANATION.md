# Understanding RAG Systems

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines retrieval-based methods with generative AI to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## The RAG Process

1. **Indexing**: Convert documents into embeddings and store them
2. **Query Encoding**: Convert user's question into an embedding 
3. **Retrieval**: Find documents with embeddings most similar to the query embedding
4. **Augmentation**: Add retrieved context to the original prompt
5. **Generation**: LLM generates a response using both the query and retrieved context

## Benefits of RAG

- Reduces hallucination in LLMs
- Provides up-to-date information beyond the model's training data
- Enables domain-specific knowledge integration
- Improves factual accuracy and relevance
- Provides citability and attribution

## Visualization Explanation

Our visualization demonstrates the key retrieval mechanism in RAG:
- The query point (red star) represents the user's question
- Document points (blue dots) represent potential knowledge sources
- The distance between points indicates semantic similarity
- In a real RAG system, the closest documents would be retrieved and used to augment the prompt

This visual representation helps understand why certain documents are retrieved for specific queries.
